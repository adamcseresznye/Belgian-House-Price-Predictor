    This app is designed to predict house prices in Belgium using data gathered from [immoweb.be](https://www.immoweb.be/en), a prominent real
    estate platform in the country. Leveraging a CatBoost model, we aim to offer accurate and current price predictions.

            Initially, we extract data from the source using the `request_html` library. Following this, we execute multiple steps to refine the raw data,
            encompassing datatype conversion from strings to numerical values and converting low cardinal numerical data to boolean. Furthermore, we leverage
            the Google Maps API to enhance location precision and obtain coordinates based on the provided location information in the advertisements.

            performance evaluation later on. It's worth noting that during the project's experimental phases, we diligently evaluated various ML algorithms, including
            decision trees, `XGBoost`, and more. After rigorous experimentation, we selected `Catboost` due to its exceptional overall performance."""
